# Sentiment-Analysis
Use jupyter notebook in python 3.6 to run the notebook file: 'Source_Code.ipnyb'
The output file is genereated when you run the code in the testing section of the notebook.

To achieve the aspect based sentiment classfication, we have used multiple classifiers like SVC, Multinomial NB, Decision tree classifer, Random forest etc.

The code gives the best results for SVM.
